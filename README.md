# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created using the MERN stack by Patrick Anderson and Jonah Getz

# Goal

Our plan is to write and create a web based RPG similar to Dunegons and Dragons that allows for seemingly infinite choices and a responsive world that changes according to the players actions. We want to use this project to practice full stack development and AI integration. 

# Development

This project began development during Christmas 2023
